# INVERTER-Characterization

***This project presents a complete CMOS inverter characterization using the SKY130 (1.8 V) PDK, designed and simulated in Xschem with Ngspice. DC, transient, and AC analyses are performed to evaluate voltage transfer characteristics, switching threshold, delay, rise/fall times, power consumption (static and dynamic), fanout, and inverter chain behavior. The results verify correct logic inversion, robust switching, and scalability under varying load and operating conditions***.

## Overview

**The CMOS inverter is the fundamental building block of digital integrated circuits. Accurate characterization of its behavior is essential for understanding delay, power consumption, noise margins, fanout capability, and scalability. This project focuses only on inverter characterization, making it ideal for beginners, academic labs, and standard‑cell pre‑characterization studies**.
